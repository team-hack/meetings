# Happy New Year!

ðŸ”” I hope you all are well and rested after the new year.  Happy New Year 2021.  I know we are off to a little bit of a late start this year, but I had some issues at home to work out these past few weeks, and also admit I was a bit  distracted by current ongoings in the news; hence gotta unplug from all that and get back to important things like this project! :)  Moving forward, we can resume normal schedule with pull requests and also work on some new projects.

## Storybook

ðŸ“š I'm going to be working on getting all pull requests looked at and merged in this week.  Hopefully you all can continue working on your branches and finish up whatever you might have been working on.  Let's try to polish up this project in the next 2-3 weeks, so we can all be proud of it.

### Checklist for your Storybook

âœ… Full checklist available at: https://github.com/team-hack/react-components/discussions/61.  Please read!

- How does it look? Is it looking good? 
  - If not, check in with us via Discord or the meetings to get some fresh pair of eyes.  I can help with UI.
- Does it have any functionality?  (E.g. `onClick`, `:hover`, `:active`)?
- Did you lint your code for syntax errors?
- Are your prop types or TypeScript props correctly checking input values?
- Have you checked against logical errors in the program?
  - Look into things like `Error Boundaries` with React
- Did you unit test your code to work as a user might expect?
- Are you refactoring your code (writing more performant code)?
  - Think about higher order functions in JavaScript, design patterns like Inversion of Control, Observer pattern, tools like React.lazy, Suspense
- Did you make your component accessible (a11y) friendly?
- Is your code self-contained or does it require dependencies? Can you reduce dependencies?
- Have I read the [discussions](https://github.com/team-hack/react-components/discussions/61) on Github? Am I on target with my project estimates on the [Github project board](https://github.com/team-hack/react-components/projects/1)?

Note, some of these we will have to do together, but as you read through this list and scan your own code, you will be better prepared to take action on anything.  As usual touch base with me if you are not sure about the above.

## Future Stuff

ðŸš€ After this project is pretty much done, let's move on to some new ideas.  I would like us to work on a "Full Stack" Project -- maybe something written in Node.js/Python/Ruby/PHP on the backend and React/Vue for the front end with MVC.  Perhaps something that looks into multiple social media sites (e.g. Reddit, Google Trends, Medium) (to see what are the most popular searches and trends) -- then cache that into our own app and make it easy for someone to see what's trending by category.  We can discuss this at the meeting.

## When's The Meeting?

ðŸ’¾ Next Team Hack Meeting is __Tuesday, January 12 at 6pm__.  See you there!  Any questions, feel free to reach out via [Discord](https://discord.gg/eZDC3rP), and I'm `@vijay` there.  See ya!
