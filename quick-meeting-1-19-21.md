# Quick Meeting

🚀 Let's meet up today for 30 minutes or so to just check on where everyone is at, as well as talk about fine-tuning our Storybook.

## Visual Design

💿 I created a Components UI Wireframe in Figma, and I'd love to have it cross-checked with what we are doing.  I'd like to also have every component we make in the Figma design match our Github/Storybook code (but still harness the power of Storybook to be really configurable).

👨‍🎨 If you have a minute, please reference the design [via here](https://www.figma.com/file/MutJR1XVX6qcrwLIm7yswB/TeamHack-Components-UI-Wireframe?node-id=0%3A1).

## Considerations

✅ Please remember to view the [checklist](https://github.com/team-hack/react-components/discussions/61), so that way your component can be really polished.  

### Controls 

🎛 Is your component using [Storybook controls](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/controls)?  If not, give the API a read and try configuring your components to allow for UI Control.

## But, I Haven't Made Any Progress Since Last Week!

All I can say is just catch up, even if you're really lagging and behind.  Rome wasn't built in a day, and my philosophy is that 20-30 minutes of coding a day is way better than cramming last minute for hours and hours.  

If you remember your school days -- you knew that the people who usually did the best and got the "A" grade were people who studied and did their homework daily -- not the people who crammed really hard at the last minute.  Rather than cram super hard and get a "C" grade, find a way to just be consistent.  If you need help, I'm here via [Discord](https://discord.gg/eZDC3rP); message `@vijay`.   

You can do it -- just think, you want to get better -- and you want to make this project mean something for you (and your career).  So keeping that in mind, bring your best foot forward.  The money and good life will follow.
