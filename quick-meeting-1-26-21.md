# Quick Meeting

🚀 Let's meet up today for 30 minutes or so to just check on where everyone is at, as well as talk about fine-tuning our Storybook.

## Visual Design

💿 I created a Components UI Wireframe in Figma, and I'd love to have it cross-checked with what we are doing.  I'd like to also have every component we make in the Figma design match our Github/Storybook code (but still harness the power of Storybook to be really configurable).

👨‍🎨 If you have a minute, please reference the design [via here](https://www.figma.com/file/MutJR1XVX6qcrwLIm7yswB/TeamHack-Components-UI-Wireframe?node-id=0%3A1).

## Considerations

✅ Please remember to view the [checklist](https://github.com/team-hack/react-components/discussions/61), so that way your component can be really polished.  

### Controls 

🎛 Is your component using [Storybook controls](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/controls)?  If not, give the API a read and try configuring your components to allow for UI Control.

## But, I Haven't Made Any Progress!

Just jump in when you can. Even though everyone is working hard, you can join in or re-join anytime.  If you are behind on an issue assigned to you, please release the issue on [our project board](https://github.com/team-hack/react-components/projects/1) and allow someone else to start working on it.  To release an issue, simply add a comment to the card you have saying "I release this".

If you need help, I'm here via [Discord](https://discord.gg/eZDC3rP); message `@vijay`.   

I know trying to code with others who seem more advanced than you feels scary.  You just have to jump in honestly, no matter what your level.
